1) Analysis with Qlik: Optimization of Bank Offers

Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of offers and promotions in a financial institution, understand acceptance/rejection patterns and propose customer retention/attraction strategies.
Main Tool: Qlik for the integration of data from multiple tables (BAU, RESELL, offers, branches, etc.) and creation of interactive dashboards.
Techniques and Skills:
Data modeling in Qlik: Relate tables by customer ID, cleaning and filtering.
Visualization: KPI for tracking offered customers, bar, pie and tabular charts to show the number of accepted vs. rejected offers, main reasons for rejection, etc.
Segment Analysis: Distinction between new vs. recurring customers, creditors vs. acquirers.
Business Proposals: Identification of opportunity areas to increase the customization of offers and the adoption of digital banking services (FinTech).

Value Provided: Facilitated strategic decisions on where to focus marketing campaigns and how to improve the acceptance rate of credit products.


2) Factors Affecting Sales Price (Excel)

Objective: Determine the key variables that affect pricing and optimize competitiveness in the market.
Main Tool: Advanced Excel (Pivot Tables, complex formulas, data analysis).
Techniques and Skills:
Importing data and consolidating sources in Excel.
Pivot Tables for breakdown by category, region or period.
Correlation analysis and simulations (e.g. price sensitivity) using functions and add-ins (Data Analysis).
Creation of internal dashboards (line, column, dispersion graphs) to identify sales peaks and compare prices vs. competitors.
Light modeling (regressions or hypothetical scenarios) to quantify the impact of each factor on the final price.

Value Provided: Provides insights on which characteristics significantly influence price determination, allowing dynamic adjustments that increase profitability and competitiveness.



3) Phylogenetic Analysis with R: Coronavirus in Different Hosts

Objective: Compare genetic sequences of coronaviruses in different species (bats, pangolin, bovine, etc.) to understand similarities and build a phylogenetic tree.
Main Tool: R (with libraries such as msa, seqinr and ape).
Techniques and Skills:
Text manipulation and sequence assembly (.txt files with nucleotides).
Basic sequence statistics: Base counting, GC vs. AT percentage, total lengths.
Multiple alignments (ClustalW) and calculation of genetic distances (identity matrix).
Phylogeny: Generation of trees (hierarchical clustering) and “fan” representation to visualize the evolutionary relationship between coronavirus variants.
Interpretation of biological results, relating genetic closeness to potential zoonosis and transmissibility.

Value Provided: Provides an evolutionary map that helps understand routes of contagion or mutations, highlighting the importance of biodiversity in the study of pathogens.
